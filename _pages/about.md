Hello! My name is HÃ©ctor Andrade. I am a problem solver that enjoys writting code in PowerShell. I like working with end users, understand their problems to propose simple solutions to streamline their daily tasks.

My proposals are a mix of the following technologies but not limited to:

* Windows Server
* PowerShell
* LAN Network
* Power BI
* Azure DevOps
* SQL

I use PowerShell as a glue to put things together. I usually use PowerShell to retrieve data from **anywhere**, store it if necessary and finally display the information with a bit of analytics.

I enjoy working with:

* PowerShell
* Power BI
* Azure DevOps
